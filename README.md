# OPL2 Audio Board
This repository contains the OPL2 Audio Board library for Arduino, Teensy, Raspberry Pi and compatible boards as well as a number of examples on how the board can be used. You can use the OPL2 Audio Board to:
* Experiment with the YM3812 chip
* Build your own synthesizer
* Play your own OPL2 tunes
* Instrument definitions from Adlib, The Fat Man and Windows 3.1 included in the library
* Play exported OPL2 music (DRO, IMF, VGM) or Reality Adlib Tracker music files
* Use the board as a MIDI synthesizer (Teensy++ 2.0 and later example included)
* Emulation with DosBox; you can use the board to output MIDI music (Teensy++ 2.0 and later)
* Use the board directly as a synthesizer by using the [OPL3BankEditor](https://github.com/Wohlstand/OPL3BankEditor) software by Wohlstand

Current library version is 1.5.3

## 1. Assembling the kit
For a step by step guide on how to assemble the kit please read the [Assembly guide](https://github.com/DhrBaksteen/ArduinoOPL2/blob/master/assembling.md).


## 2. Installing the library
#### Arduino / Teensy
The easiest way to install the library it do download it through the Arduino Library Manager. Open the Library Manager from your Arduino IDE's Sketch > Include Library > Library Manager menu. A new window will open that allows you to search for a library. Search for 'Arduino OPL2' and it should show this libarary. Select the library, click the install button and you're good to go.

Alternatively you can clone this repo in the `libraries` folder of the Arduino IDE. or you can download the zip file and extract it in the libraries folder.

For more information see the [instructions](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries) on the Arduino website.

#### Raspberry Pi / Orange Pi and compatibles
To install the library onto your Pi clone this repo and run `./build`. The OPL2 library requires [WiringPi](http://wiringpi.com/) to be installed on your Pi. Normally this library is already installed, but if this is not the case then the build script can install it for you.


## 3. Connecting the OPL2 Audio Board
You can connect the OPL2 Audio Board directly to a speaker, however for the best results I recommend you connect some active (amplified) speakers. Headphones or line level recording will also work great. See the table below how to connect the OPL2 Audio Board to an Arduino. [Visit the wiki](https://github.com/DhrBaksteen/ArduinoOPL2/wiki/Connecting) to learn how to connect the OPL2 AUdio Board to your favorite development platform.

#### Arduino
| OPL2 Board | Arduino Pin |
|------------|-------------|
| A0 | 9 |
| Data | 11 |
| Latch | 10 |
| Shift | 13 |
| Reset | 8 |


## 4. Using the OPL2 Audio Board
#### Arduino
After installing the library and restarting the Arduino IDE you will find a number of examples under the File > Examples > ArduinoOPL2 menu. These examples can be found in the `examples` folder of the library.

#### Teensy
Most Arduino examples will also work directly on a Teensy. The examples that require an SD card (PlayDRO, PlayIMG and PlayRAD) are Teensy specific when you use the Teensy's on board SD card slot. Teensy++ 2.0 and later can be configured as MIDI device. An example for this can be found among the Teensy specific examples in the `examples/teensy` folder.

#### Raspberry Pi / Orange Pi
After building the library you will find a number of examples in the `examples_pi` folder. The examples have been compiled during installation of the library, so you should be ready to dive right in! Try running `sudo ./demotune` for example from the `examples_pi/demotune` folder.

When compiling your own code using the OPL2 library don't forget to specify the library using the `-lOPL2` argument e.g. `gcc -std=c++11 -Wall -o my_program my_program.cpp -lOPL2 -lwiringPi`
